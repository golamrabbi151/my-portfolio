                            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
                            text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from
                            45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                            Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up
                            one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem
                            Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                            classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
                            Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
                            Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                            written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                            ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
                            Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
                            in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since
                            the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
                            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by
                            Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                            accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
                            Rackham.
